# HashRoute

## Performance
HashRoute has been designed with performance in mind and the numbers reflect that: HashRoute is _ultra_ fast. We're talking sub <i>micro</i>seconds per route. In fact, HashRoute is so fast that Java's `System.nanotime()` simply doesn't have the resolution to accurately measure single routes.
